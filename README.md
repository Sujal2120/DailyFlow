# dayflow-hrms

Lightweight HRMS UI built with React, Vite and Tailwind CSS. This repo contains a demo app (Dayflow) focused on attendance, leaves and simple payroll UI components.

## What I added

- Project scaffold (Vite + React)
- Tailwind CSS setup
- Example components and mock data in `src/App.jsx`

## How to run locally

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd 'c:\Users\Sujal Pandey\Downloads\dayflow-hrms'
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Create a GitHub repo and push (one-time)

Replace `<your-username>` and run the following from the project root:

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/dayflow-hrms.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If you prefer to create the repo via the GitHub web UI, create an *empty* repo and copy the `git remote add` URL shown there.
